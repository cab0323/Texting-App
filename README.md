## General Info
This project is a little project that I created moslty to get used to creating a Python GUI. 
The project lets the user add users to a directory and read from that directory. As well as let 
the user send a text to that user or a bunch of users in the directory. 

## Technology 
I used [library] to send a text. It send an email from my email adress to the email adress of att which in turn
will redirect it to the phone number of the user. Only works if the user has att as their provider.
